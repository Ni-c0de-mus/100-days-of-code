# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 05, 2019
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Followed a mobile first nav tutorial by 'Edutechion'.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to embed the structure and nomenclature of HTML and CSS so that I can do something more inspiring on my own such as cloning other web pages. When I am happy with this I can start to integrate Javascript and do the same, it's a lot to begin with but I feel I am progressing, start of repeating simple tasks and projects and when I feel familiar enough expand on this.

### Day 1 September 06, 2019
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Created a page with a simple navbar to contain a Javascript timer tutorial by Tyler Potts

**Thoughts**: Well I tried to create a simple navbar from memory, I got the HTML down ok but I didn't use any icons for now, I needed to refer to tutorials/previous code to remember which tags to apply certain styles to so that the element effected the correct items. I will make more concise notes on this then rinse repeat. In fact I am going to handwrite several navbar/HTML/CSS/JS combinations so that I can easily refer to and practice. Everytime I do a tutorial I will start with a navbar and one day I will be able to do it from memory, that will be so cool. At the same time I am going to clone sites and as I progress I will intergrate Javascript and become more familiar with that and hopefully an employer will see that I can at least be productive and have a good idea in the way of a progressive education.

### Day 2 September 07, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a page with different navbar as HTML/CSS/JS design practice, Julio Codes

**Thoughts** Had a busy day so only managed a few hours, I got the nav done but I needed to stop as I had to start thinking a bit and I was tired best leave it until tomorrow. Basically I want to use this responsive nav and get used to creating div with position/text/images to clone web designs as practice. So tomorrow I should put the images in, and maybe create a stylish price list for stylish sites, eventually I want to use some simple CSS/JS animations to spice it up a bit but nothing to fancy and oh yeh cool fonts and colors.

### Day 3 September 08, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Contineud with the navbar/website as previous day.

**Thoughts** Today I added some images with text, had a busy day today so didn't do so much but I am pleased as the basic form is taking place, getting used to divs, tag names, which divs to apply certain CSS rules to so they function properly, at the moment it's still all mobile view but it's looking ok, I will add a few more divs to play around with and hopefully a price list and a footer then make it reponsive, don't know if I will do all that today but thinking ahead, need to print out the code and make notes to fix it in my mind better.
