# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 05, 2019
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Followed a mobile first nav tutorial by 'Edutechion'.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to embed the structure and nomenclature of HTML and CSS so that I can do something more inspiring on my own such as cloning other web pages. When I am happy with this I can start to integrate Javascript and do the same, it's a lot to begin with but I feel I am progressing, start of repeating simple tasks and projects and when I feel familiar enough expand on this.

### Day 1 September 06, 2019
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Created a page with a simple navbar to contain a Javascript timer tutorial by Tyler Potts

**Thoughts**: Well I tried to create a simple navbar from memory, I got the HTML down ok but I didn't use any icons for now, I needed to refer to tutorials/previous code to remember which tags to apply certain styles to so that the element effected the correct items. I will make more concise notes on this then rinse repeat. In fact I am going to handwrite several navbar/HTML/CSS/JS combinations so that I can easily refer to and practice. Everytime I do a tutorial I will start with a navbar and one day I will be able to do it from memory, that will be so cool. At the same time I am going to clone sites and as I progress I will intergrate Javascript and become more familiar with that and hopefully an employer will see that I can at least be productive and have a good idea in the way of a progressive education.

### Day 2 September 07, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a page with different navbar as HTML/CSS/JS design practice, Julio Codes

**Thoughts** Had a busy day so only managed a few hours, I got the nav done but I needed to stop as I had to start thinking a bit and I was tired best leave it until tomorrow. Basically I want to use this responsive nav and get used to creating div with position/text/images to clone web designs as practice. So tomorrow I should put the images in, and maybe create a stylish price list for stylish sites, eventually I want to use some simple CSS/JS animations to spice it up a bit but nothing to fancy and oh yeh cool fonts and colors.

### Day 3 September 08, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Contineud with the navbar/website as previous day.

**Thoughts** Today I added some images with text, had a busy day today so didn't do so much but I am pleased as the basic form is taking place, getting used to divs, tag names, which divs to apply certain CSS rules to so they function properly, at the moment it's still all mobile view but it's looking ok, I will add a few more divs to play around with and hopefully a price list and a footer then make it reponsive, don't know if I will do all that today but thinking ahead, need to print out the code and make notes to fix it in my mind better.

### Day 4 September 09, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Navbar tutorial but added a section of my own and altered some CSS to my liking.

**Thoughts** I continued with the previous tutorial, I have added a section of my own and altered a few things for me to practice.
So basically I added 6 sections of text to practice grid and flex and put images behind the text so I learned the CSS for that and it was in my mind to create a stylish/classy list but in reality that would take a bit of work and after an hour or so I decided to do that another time and just continue because I was loosing the thread of the main tutorial and my head was getting scatty with remembering the structure of the CSS, I realized you need to build the structure and know it so to have coherence and to keep the code DRY, don't repeat yourself so being that I was following along it was getting a bit messy, not too bad though but it's still quite difficult to retain everything and have different class names. Instead of a stylish list I settled for blocks of text as really I wanted to get my head around grid and flex and positioning. I had some Eureka moment centering text, which sounds simple but I am learning which divs to apply the CSS to to effect the styles properly, I wanted to position a button and had to create a new div for it, flex and center it but eh it worked and I was happy with that as this is one thing I wanted to learn to start making quick loading high convertion mobile sites. I didn't yet make it responsive I will do that tomorrow as I have been busy and it's a long day!

### Day 5 September 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finshed the navbar website project by making it responsive

**Thoughts** Well I don't usually take so many days to do one tutorial/project as it is hard to retain the structure and what I am learning but I did  accomplish some small goals in the way of remembering and figuring out CSS and applying it and becoming more aware of how it all interacts but I guess rinse repeat. To make it responsive it's hiding the nav icons, flexing the nav-bar, resizing and positioning text and adding margin here and there to element like buttons so the visual integrity of the site remains. Adding an underline animation to the nav-links etc. It's quite late and I have squeezed in coding after long days so hey ho feeling a bit tired now but glad I have done it, really it got a bit drawn out and I'd rather do it in a shorter time so my uptake of learning is more coherent.
My plan to learn coding or rather my ideas to comprehend and remember are as follows.
Print out pages of code and spend some time analysing the structure and make my own template.
Find random Javascript examples and write down questions about the code, what it does, how it relates to the rest of the code.
Start to copy random websites and become proficient in CSS GRID & FLEX with responsiveness and start to add Javascript and possibly PHP as I go to build up my idea of code structure and syntax using my creativity which will hopefully help me retain it more easily.
I have to write down a list of primary CSS to rinse repeat and then learn some more fancy and complicated things like animations etc.
I thinks that is enough for tonight an I will start something new tomo after maybe a short tutorial. Goodnight all! ;o)
NB it's Septmber 11th now and I  really hope that no-one attacks me with thermite and direct energy weapons and pretends that it is a plane! Sleep well! ;o)

### Day 6 September 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a project called Navbar Collection and followed and ad-libd one nav bar to start.

**Thoughts** Ok so I had the idea to put together a collection of nav bar codings in one git-res so that I  can print them out and examine the code more easily and take notes and create a check list of classes and element so that I can get my head around where to put them in the code for them to have the desired effect - like a tree of efficacy. Then I can start to code nav bars on my own and try eventually to need as little reference as possible to make the basic navs work and then try and make some cool designs of my own. I guess I am trying to find the best way of learning as I go along. I know that writing things down is the best way of remembering and now the novelty of tutorials is wearing of this is where the rubber hits the road with my brain I want to be able to code this shit myself and be able to dive in and create and have that imagination where I can know enough to have an idea and be able to implement it effectibely; and also to be able to make mistakes without getting completely confused and lost.
I will have this done in as many days as it takes for me to be satisfied with the amount of content and then I will print out a few copies and use highlighters to comprehend and repeat the layouts. Happy days! Now Wat Thunder patch 1.9 came out yesterday and I am going to try my hand at tanks lol

### Day 7 September 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I made the previous Nav responsive.

**Thoughts** Hey ho, well I had intended to do a bit more but realised there was a bit more to know first, I wanted to make the nav roll in on itself a bit like curtains drawing but from either side, I thought to use the right and left classes and then maybe the width and height by using a transformation and setting the values to zero but it didn't seem to work so instead I just made it responsive and will watch some tutorials on CSS transitions, generally I spend 3 or 4 hours coding so having a slightly shorter session I forgive myself.
I added a the links between Nav pages so I can switch betweent them but really the files need tidying up a bit, happy days it's all learning! ;o)

### Day 8 September 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched some videos on YT about animating properties in CSS and CSS transitions, not my most productive day but It's a watery full moon. The best things to animate are position, scale, rotation/translate and opacity, so I am seeing what is the best thing to do. I still want to create a nav that starts from invisible and appear/grows out from the center, I thought 50% left right? Anyway I will be back when I have figured it out.

**Thoughts** Learning from videos but not my most productive day, had a look at some blockchain stuff, finding transactions on the blockchain, addressess et al.

### Day 9 September 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I made the nav do the curtain thing! Wehoo, I hope I can remember all this! ;o)

**Thoughts** I had a thought of how to get the nav to transform and from my thoughts, I had three ideas and one of them worked and that was to set the open to
right: -50%;
left: 50%;
top: 50%;
bottom: -50%;
and the closed to zero all values and eh it worked, might seem simple to you guys but for me it's one of the first times I managed to think and apply an idea in code, shit I hope I can remember it lol
