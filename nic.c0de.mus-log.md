# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 05, 2019
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Followed a mobile first nav tutorial by 'Edutechion'.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to embed the structure and nomenclature of HTML and CSS so that I can do something more inspiring on my own such as cloning other web pages. When I am happy with this I can start to integrate Javascript and do the same, it's a lot to begin with but I feel I am progressing, start of repeating simple tasks and projects and when I feel familiar enough expand on this.

### Day 1 September 06, 2019
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Created a page with a simple navbar to contain a Javascript timer tutorial by Tyler Potts

**Thoughts**: Well I tried to create a simple navbar from memory, I got the HTML down ok but I didn't use any icons for now, I needed to refer to tutorials/previous code to remember which tags to apply certain styles to so that the element effected the correct items. I will make more concise notes on this then rinse repeat. In fact I am going to handwrite several navbar/HTML/CSS/JS combinations so that I can easily refer to and practice. Everytime I do a tutorial I will start with a navbar and one day I will be able to do it from memory, that will be so cool. At the same time I am going to clone sites and as I progress I will intergrate Javascript and become more familiar with that and hopefully an employer will see that I can at least be productive and have a good idea in the way of a progressive education.
