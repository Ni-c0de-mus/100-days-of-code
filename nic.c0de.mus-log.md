**Today's Progress**: Followed a mobile first nav tutorial by 'Edutechion'.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to embed the structure and nomenclature of HTML and CSS so that I can do something more inspiring on my own such as cloning other web pages. When I am happy with this I can start to integrate Javascript and do the same, it's a lot to begin with but I feel I am progressing, start of repeating simple tasks and projects and when I feel familiar enough expand on this.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
